# Reproducible game naming

Deko owns the naming scripts and one current rule manifest per named game.
`java-tools` owns generic decompiler recovery. `funorb-decompiled` publishes
Java directly in `games/<game>`, with a reading guide
beside the sources. There is no second published Java tree or committed stub
JAR. One current `decompilation/<game>-naming.json` dictionary records reverse
edits, source/compiler identities, symbol verification and export provenance.

Use sibling checkouts or set `FUNORB_DECOMPILED_DIR`, then run:

```sh
env -u JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS node readable/build-geoblox-rules.mjs --check
env -u JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS node readable/reproduce-geoblox.mjs --update
env -u JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS node readable/reproduce-geoblox.mjs --check
env -u JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS node readable/build-dekobloko-rules.mjs --check
env -u JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS node readable/reproduce-dekobloko.mjs --update
env -u JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS node readable/reproduce-dekobloko.mjs --check
env -u JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS node readable/build-armiesofgielinor-rules.mjs --check
env -u JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS node readable/reproduce-armiesofgielinor.mjs --update
env -u JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS node readable/reproduce-armiesofgielinor.mjs --check
node readable/restore-game.mjs dekobloko /tmp/restored-dekobloko
node scripts/check-source-catalog.mjs /absolute/path/to/funorb-decompiled
node --test scripts/test-publish-decompiled-games.mjs readable/tests/test-game-publication.mjs
```

The exporter reads raw Java from its exact pinned Git commit, builds signature
stubs from tracked `stubs/src` into temporary storage, compiles both complete
corpora and verifies every resolved declaration, reference and override. It
stages Java, guide, dictionary and catalog receipt before replacing the current
game; failed metadata installation restores the previous game and receipt.
Checks and reverse reconstruction also use temporary storage, never `.work`.
The frozen generic naming dependency remains under `tools`, bound by `PIN.json`.

## Armies of Gielinor

The first pass names 39 reviewed classes around battlefield state, units, map
tiles, teams, gameplay coordination, movement, AI, tutorial, events and packet
decoding. Reviewed fields and operations carry source evidence in the one
current `armiesofgielinor-rules.json` manifest. Unknown names remain unknown;
packed flags use bit-position names until their gameplay meanings are proved.
Override names propagate through resolved contracts, and label targets remain
unchanged. The frozen Java compiler input is read from Git, not the current
named export.

Every export compares raw and named core execution with independent expected
results for rectangular map lookup, alliances, unit flags and damage, and tile
metadata. The probe bypasses battlefield construction and Applet initialization,
so it is not a full gameplay or multiplayer-server test. Three dispatcher files
and large methods remain; this is a semantic naming pass, not control-flow recovery.

## Deko Bloko

The first pass covers all 343 classes and the opaque member/parameter/local
names. Reviewed names identify the board, session, pieces, sprites, packets,
client and platform/UI/audio roots. Other names describe only a structural
category or declaration type; their finer purposes remain explicitly unresolved.
Numbered labels are deterministic, with original spellings in the dictionary.

The board fields and main operations use the existing original-bytecode
multiplayer differential as evidence. Every export also compares 160 synthetic
snapshot states against the pinned raw Java, with independent expectations for
board geometry, lives, controls, countdowns and decoded cells. Both variants
use the same headless client boundary. This checks snapshot decoding, not full
multiplayer execution or whole-game equivalence.

## GeoBlox

The layout migration preserves all 303 reviewed Java files byte for byte and
all 20,133 complete naming rules. Its source pin still identifies the reviewed
raw compiler snapshot in Git history. The current workflow and source-built
stub dependency are explicitly pinned by the migration manifest.

Existing native GeoBlox probes obtain their raw/named source pair and compilation
stubs through a temporary compatibility view in `layout.mjs`; no compatibility
folder exists in the publication. Historical structural proof scripts and
compiler opt-in settings describe frozen prior passes and must be replayed from
their recorded Git tool/input commits. Their pass narratives remain in Git
history, rather than accumulating in this current README.

Generic readability runs by default. Game naming maps and specific relocations
remain explicit integration inputs. Browser/phone memory and presented-FPS
acceptance remain unverified.
